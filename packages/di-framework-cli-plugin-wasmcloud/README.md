# @di-framework/cli-plugin-wasmcloud

di-framework CLI extension for targeting [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com): build a DI Framework
HTTP app into a WASI 0.3 WebAssembly component, serve it locally, and deploy it from a workspace
manifest.

```bash
di-framework extensions install wasmcloud

di-framework wasmcloud build                         # bundle + jco componentize → dist/<name>.wasm
di-framework wasmcloud dev                           # build, then serve locally (wasmtime by default)
di-framework wasmcloud deploy                        # nearest project, default target
di-framework wasmcloud deploy greeter                # named project anywhere in the workspace
di-framework wasmcloud deploy greeter --target development
di-framework wasmcloud destroy greeter
di-framework wasmcloud platform init                 # generate deploy/platform + local target
di-framework wasmcloud platform deploy local --yes   # start the generated platform
di-framework wasmcloud platform destroy local --yes
di-framework wasmcloud doctor                        # project + toolchain readiness checks
```

Run these commands directly. Do not wrap them in `package.json` scripts.

## Project convention

A component project is marked by `di-framework.config.json`:

```json
{ "name": "my-app", "entry": "src/app.ts", "output": "dist/my-app.wasm" }
```

Named wasmCloud host-interface bindings live in `src/bindings.ts` (override with `"bindings"`).
Each exported class extending a `@di-framework/wasmcloud` base and decorated with
`@WasmCloudBinding('name')` is discovered statically and added to the WIT requirement graph.
The binding name selects its configuration overlay and normally becomes `hostInterfaces[].name`.
For `wasmcloud:postgres`, `wasmcloud:keyvalue`, `wasmcloud:blobstore`,
`wasmcloud:messaging`, and `wasmcloud:secrets`, host declarations omit the name to
select the provider route that links QuickJS imports. The generated guest world uses unlabeled
`import pkg/iface@version` statements because `jco --backend qjs` cannot encode
`import name: pkg/iface` (`cm-implements`). Secret values are never taken from source;
`secretFrom` defaults to `<application>-<binding>`. Unnamed bindings such as config and
outgoing HTTP retain their overlays through the binding class that contributed the requirements.

Host declarations reflect the interfaces advertised by the runtime: key-value `types`
is linked internally, and the core links `wasi:http/client`. Both remain in the guest WIT
imports but are omitted from host discovery. HTTP ingress and outgoing requirements
share one unnamed host declaration per version, retaining configuration from both.
Outgoing requests also require the workload component’s `localResources.allowedHosts`
to allow the destination; the binding itself does not grant egress access.

Build writes `.di-framework/guests.js` with real WIT `import * as` specifiers and installs
those modules on `globalThis` before the application runs, which is how
`@di-framework/wasmcloud` constructors receive the guest.

The configured `name` is the only project identity. The extension owns the WebAssembly/WASI
boundary: it records WIT requirements (the HTTP adapter exports `wasi:http/handler@0.3.0` today),
generates one world and a `wit.lock.json` from that graph, bundles the entry behind a WASI-HTTP ↔
Web Fetch adapter, and componentizes with `@di-framework/componentize-qjs` (a wasmtime-48
fork of componentize-qjs 0.4.4 that can stub imported `async func`s such as
`wasmcloud:postgres@0.2.0`). Set `DI_FRAMEWORK_COMPONENTIZE_QJS` to override the
resolved CLI.

The bootstrap installs text encoding and Fetch globals before evaluating application
imports, including Node modules with module-level constants. `node:timers` and global
`setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `setImmediate` use the WASI monotonic clock. Timer
handles support cancellation, refresh, and ref/unref flags; process-lifetime ref
semantics do not apply to an invocation-driven component.

`node:async_hooks` supplies context scopes and binding. The bundler lowers async
functions and `for await` loops into Promise continuations, whose callbacks retain
the calling context. Timer callbacks also retain context. Native async-generator
bodies and dynamically evaluated async code are not instrumented by this transform.

A workload must explicitly permit WASI DNS lookups. Add hostnames or wildcard suffixes
to the project configuration, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "socket-app",
  "entry": "src/app.ts",
  "allowedIpNameLookups": ["echo.wasmcloud.svc.cluster.local"]
}
```

The deployer writes these names under the component's
`localResources.allowedIpNameLookups`. Omission keeps the host's default denial;
it does not implicitly grant unrestricted DNS access.

Guest JS keeps the framework's Node contract. The bundler runs [unenv](https://github.com/unjs/unenv)
`nodeCompat` plus a wasmCloud preset: `node:path`, `Buffer`, and the rest of
the Node builtin map come from unenv; `node:fs` is an in-memory filesystem (with `ENOENT`),
`process.env` / `process.cwd()` are guest-shaped (not the host process), and `createRequire` throws
`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. `node:net` and `node:dgram` overlay WASI 0.3 `wasi:sockets` (`tcp-socket` /
`udp-socket` / `ip-name-lookup`) so `@di-framework/socket`'s Node TCP/UDP adapters run unchanged.
`node:crypto` overlays `wasi:random@0.3.0` plus guest hashes and the Web Crypto subset used by
socket security (`createHash` / `createHmac` / `randomBytes` / `randomUUID` / `subtle` HMAC, HKDF,
AES-GCM, ECDH P-256). `node:http` is HTTP/1.1 on that TCP overlay (`createServer`, `request` /
`get`, `'upgrade'`) so the Node WebSocket adapter (`ws`) can handshake. Those WIT imports are added
to the guest world only when the bundle actually uses them; they are runtime WASI, not wasmCloud
`hostInterfaces`. `node:tls` supplies client `connect` / `TLSSocket` (including an existing
`node:net` socket for STARTTLS) through the host's `wasi:tls/client@0.3.0-draft` encryption
and decryption streams. `node:https` supplies HTTP/1.1 `request` / `get` and an Agent
that carries connection options; requests wait for verified `secureConnect` before sending.
`child_process` stays an unenv mock. Config files from the project (`*.json` / `*.yaml` / `*.toml` / `.env`) are
seeded into that filesystem at componentize time. Do not put secrets in those files. Stock jco 1.32.1 / componentize-qjs 0.4.4 uses wasmtime 47,
which stubs unknown imports with sync `func_new` and fails at wizer with
`type mismatch with async`. Sync imports such as `wasi:config@0.2.0-rc.1` also
componentize with stock jco and run on `wasmtime serve -S config`. Build state
lives in the disposable `.di-framework/` directory.

TLS requires a host with the opt-in `wasi-tls` feature, such as a TLS-enabled
`wash-runtime` build, or Wasmtime 48 with `-S p3=y,tls=y,inherit-network=y,allow-ip-name-lookup=y`.
The draft WIT is pinned to the wasmCloud interface; importing TLS or HTTPS adds it to the
component world automatically. `wasmcloud dev` enables TLS and outbound network access
automatically when using Wasmtime for a component that imports TLS. Other runners need
their own TLS-enabled host configuration. A host without TLS cannot instantiate that component.
See [wasmCloud host TLS configuration](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/runtime/building-custom-hosts/#tls-for-wasitls-components).

Certificate chain and server-name verification are mandatory and use the host's trust store.
Use `servername` when connecting by address to a DNS-named service, and configure private
CA trust on the host, including in local development. Guest `ca` / client certificates,
`rejectUnauthorized: false`, custom identity checks, TLS versions/ciphers, ALPN, sessions,
and certificate inspection are unsupported and throw explicit errors. Server-side
`tls.createServer` / `https.createServer` are unsupported; incoming HTTPS terminates at
the host ingress. This is a client subset, without connection pooling or HTTP/2.
Use `tls.connect(options)` rather than calling `.connect()` on a `TLSSocket`.

HTTPS responses without `Content-Length` or chunked encoding finish only when the
peer closes the connection. If the peer keeps it open, the response can wait indefinitely.
Set `options.timeout` and destroy the request in its `timeout` handler; the timeout
is an inactivity notification and does not cancel the request automatically:

```ts
import { get } from 'node:https';

const req = get('https://example.com/', { timeout: 10_000 }, (res) => {
  res.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));
  res.on('error', (error) => console.error(error));
});
req.on('timeout', () => req.destroy(new Error('HTTPS request timed out')));
req.on('error', (error) => console.error(error));
```

Use a separate deadline timer if the entire operation must finish within a fixed
time, including a peer that keeps sending data without closing the response.

Run `DI_WASI_TLS_SMOKE=1 bun test tests/node-compat-tls-native.test.ts` from this package
to compile and exercise both clients against real Wasmtime TLS. This opt-in check needs
the componentizer, Wasmtime 48, OpenSSL, and network access to `example.com`; it also
starts a temporary local HTTPS server to confirm that an untrusted certificate is rejected.

Package versions are independent of the component-model preview: a WASI 0.3 guest may
still import `wasmcloud:*` packages at their own versions.

Local `wasmcloud dev` uses `wasmtime serve -S cli -S p3 -S config` when wasmtime 46+ is on
PATH, then `wash dev`, then `jco serve`. Set `DI_FRAMEWORK_WASMCLOUD_DEV_RUNNER` to
`wasmtime`, `wash`, or `jco` to pin one. Wasmtime hosts WASI HTTP and unlabeled
`wasi:config` locally (`-S config-var=key=value` to seed values). wasmCloud-only imports
such as `wasmcloud:postgres` still need `wash` or a wasmCloud host.

`wash` 2.5.x has no `--address` flag. The extension writes
`.di-framework/wash-dev.yaml` (`dev.address`, `host_interfaces`,
`wasm_proposals: [component-model-async]`) and runs `wash dev --user-config` against it.
Set `WASMCLOUD_POSTGRES_URL` to populate `dev.postgres_url`; never put secrets in source.

## Deployment manifest

Deployment topology lives in `di-framework.deploy.toml` at the workspace root. The CLI finds it by
walking upward from the current directory. The file describes **targets**, not applications: there
is no `apps` table, and projects may live in any directory layout.

```toml
default-target = "local"

[targets.local]
platform = "deploy/platform"
stack = "dev"

[targets.development]
kubeconfig = "${KUBECONFIG}"
context = "team-development"
namespace = "wasmcloud"

[targets.development.registry]
push = "https://registry.example.com/team"
pull = "registry.internal.example.com/team"
insecure = false
```

- `di-framework wasmcloud deploy` with no name uses the nearest `di-framework.config.json`.
- `di-framework wasmcloud deploy greeter` recursively discovers projects (skipping `.git`,
  `node_modules`, `.di-framework`, and generated output by default) and matches the configured
  `name`. Duplicate names fail with every conflicting path.
- `${VAR}` interpolation fails if the variable is unset or empty. Do not put credentials in the
  manifest.

### Managed Pulumi target

From the workspace root, generate a self-contained local platform (k0s, a local OCI registry, and
the wasmCloud operator) from templates shipped with this extension:

```bash
di-framework wasmcloud platform init
di-framework wasmcloud platform deploy local --yes
```

`platform init` writes `deploy/platform` and creates or updates `di-framework.deploy.toml` so
`local` is a managed target (`platform = "deploy/platform"`, `stack = "dev"`). Existing files are
left alone unless you pass `--force`. The command prints the exact start command when it finishes.
Platform deploy runs the package-manager-neutral `pulumi install` command automatically, so the
generated project works immediately in a blank consumer workspace without a root workspace entry
or a manual install inside `deploy/platform`.

The generated Pulumi project provisions only platform concerns. It has workspace- and stack-scoped
Docker names, a dedicated network, persistent k0s state/log volumes, pinned images and chart,
readiness checks, and loopback-only high ports. It must not contain application names, component
builds, application Services, or WorkloadDeployments. The defaults are Kubernetes `26443`, registry
`25000`, and HTTP `28180`; set `apiPort`, `registryPort`, or `httpPort` with `pulumi config set` in
`deploy/platform` to choose another distinct port from 1024 through 65535.

The CLI reads a small output contract from `pulumi stack output --json`:

| Output | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kubeconfig` | yes | kubeconfig YAML or a filesystem path |
| `namespace` | yes | Kubernetes namespace for workloads |
| `registry` | yes | legacy string shorthand, or `{ push, pull, insecure }` transport object |
| `context` | no | kubectl context |
| `endpoints.http` / `endpoints.kubernetes` / `endpoints.registry` | no | optional URLs |

Provision and tear down that stack explicitly:

```bash
di-framework wasmcloud platform deploy local --yes
di-framework wasmcloud platform destroy local --yes
```

Application `destroy` never runs `pulumi destroy`.

The generated local target publishes through its loopback registry NodePort and puts the equivalent
in-cluster registry address in the WorkloadDeployment. Both references use the same repository and
stable canonical-input tag. An `http://` push URL or `insecure = true` adds ORAS `--plain-http` only
for that target; TLS remains the default everywhere else.

### Existing cluster

When kubeconfig and a registry are already available, declare an external target with only access
information (as `development` above) and deploy:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.kube/config"
di-framework wasmcloud deploy greeter --target development
```

## Application deploy

For the selected project the extension:

1. Builds the component.
2. Publishes it with `oras` from the project root using project-relative artifact paths and a stable
   canonical-input reference (`<registry>/<wit-name>:sha256-<deployment-digest>`). The actual
   component-byte digest is calculated and reported separately because ComponentizeJS snapshots may
   vary byte-for-byte for identical inputs.
3. Derives a wasmCloud `WorkloadDeployment` and Kubernetes `Service` (written under `.di-framework/deploy/`, not checked in).
4. Configures `wasi:http/handler@0.3.0` with the project name as its host, applies the resources,
   and waits for current `Ready=True` or compatible older readiness schemas.

For the generated local platform the result reports the HTTP URL and required Host header. It is
directly reachable without `kubectl port-forward`, for example:

```sh
curl -H 'Host: greeter' http://127.0.0.1:28180/
```

## Demonstration layout

A complete workspace is in [`examples/workspace`](./examples/workspace): `deploy/platform` plus
projects at `services/greeter` and `nested/deep/echo`. Copy that tree or start from the TOML
above.

The manifest contract for extensions is documented in
[`@di-framework/cli-extension`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@di-framework/cli-extension).

## Live integration test

The opt-in test packs the CLI and extension dependencies, installs those tarballs in a blank
temporary workspace, and runs the full platform/application lifecycle against Docker:

```sh
DI_FRAMEWORK_WASMCLOUD_LIVE=1 bun test packages/di-framework-cli-plugin-wasmcloud/tests/live-workflow.test.ts
```

It requires Docker, Pulumi, kubectl, ORAS, npm, Bun, and curl. The test selects unused loopback
ports and removes its scoped platform resources in a `finally` cleanup.

## Actor Integration with wasmCloud

The wasmCloud plugin natively integrates virtual actors from `@di-framework/actors` into WebAssembly components and Kubernetes deployments.

### 1. Build-Time Actor Scanning & Dispatch Generation
- **Static Discovery**: During `di-framework wasmcloud build`, source files are scanned for `@Actor` and `@ActorMethod` decorators using TypeScript AST analysis.
- **Dispatch Module Generation**: The build generates `.di-framework/actors.js` which explicitly imports actor classes, registers them with `ActorRuntime`, sets up `SqliteActorStorage`, and exports `dispatchActorInvocation`. This prevents registered actors and their methods from being eliminated by Rolldown tree-shaking.
- **Private Invocations**: Invocations are delivered privately via `/_actors/invoke` or private service bindings without exposing public HTTP routes.

### 2. Runtime Execution Model
- **Activation & Scheduling**: Actor activations live in-memory within the host component instance. Per-actor mailbox queues asynchronously serialize calls to the same actor identity (`namespace:actorName:actorKey`) while allowing distinct actors to execute concurrently.
- **Host Storage Capabilities**: Persistent storage is bound via host capabilities (filesystem volume mount at `/data/actors`, configured via `ACTOR_STORAGE_DIR`). Each actor has an isolated SQLite database file with single-writer process file locking.
- **Transactions & Migrations**: Method invocations execute within actor-scoped transactions that commit on success and roll back on errors. Schema migrations run automatically before an actor's first activation; migration failures reject activation before calls can proceed.

### 3. Deployment & Operating Safety Constraints
- **Single-Host Constraint**: To ensure data consistency and prevent database split-brain with SQLite file locking, actor workloads enforce `replicas: 1`. Accidental configurations with `replicas > 1` are rejected with `WASMCLOUD_ACTORS_REPLICA_CONSTRAINT`.
- **Persistent Volumes**: Generated manifests provision a Kubernetes `PersistentVolumeClaim` mounted at `/data/actors`.
- **Upgrade & Drain Behavior**: The workload uses Kubernetes rollout `strategy: { type: "Recreate" }`, guaranteeing that the terminating pod drains active calls and releases SQLite locks before the new version activates and executes pending migrations.
- **Single-Host vs. Distributed**: Single-host wasmCloud actor deployment is designed for standalone, resilient edge or single-node deployments. Distributed actor clustering, key partitioning, and remote consensus across wasmCloud nodes are part of distributed actor capabilities.
